## 🧩 Projects I’m Currently Working On

#### Ongoing C++ Programs:
I am currently working on a series of small C++ programs to deepen my understanding of functions, classes, arrays, and basic data structures as part of my upcoming programming assessment. 
These include:
1. **Average Speed:** Calculates travel speed using distance and time inputs.
2. **Winning Division:** Compares four regional sales figures and identifies the top performer.
3. **Time:** Builds a 24-hour clock class, converts to 12-hour format, and outputs greetings.
4. **Student Performance Class:** Combines academic and activity scores to compute a final grade.
5. **Grade Analysis:** Maps numeric scores into grade bands and provides simple statistics.
6. **Index of Smallest Number:** Finds and returns the index of the smallest value in an array.
7. **Number of Occurrences:** Counts how many times each value appears in a list.
8. **Lottery Winners:** Compares user ticket numbers with winning numbers to detect winners.
9. **Test Scores #1:** Reads test scores from input and calculates their average.
10.**Test Scores #2:** Extends score processing with grade classification based on average.

## 🚀 Projects I’ve Completed So Far

#### Small Programs in C++:
As part of my programming assessment, I have created various beginner-level programs in C++ which has strengthen my understanding and logic. 
These include:
1. **Monthly Income:** Calculates monthly income with breakdowns for basic pay, bonuses, and allowances.
2. **Height in Meters:** Converts user height from feet and inches to meters.
3. **Annual High Temperatures:** Projects average July temperatures if they rise by 15% in selected cities.
4. **How Much Paint:** Estimates tins of paint needed for a wooden fence based on its size.
5. **Letter Shape:** Displays specific letter patterns using console output.
6. **Burger Stall:** Computes total daily sales based on burger quantities sold, formatting results to two decimal places.
7. **Project Hours:** Tallies and displays hours and minutes spent on a project by contributors.
8. **House Budget:** Sums up monthly and annual expenses for housing, utilities, and other essentials.
9. **Coin Toss Simulation:** Simulates a coin toss and checks if the user's guess matches the result.
10. **Area of a Triangle:** Determines the area from three given sides using a math formula.
11. **Rainfall Report:** Reads rainfall data from a file and calculates total and average values for a period.
12. **Distance Traveled:** Calculates and displays total distance traveled by a vehicle at the end of each hour.
